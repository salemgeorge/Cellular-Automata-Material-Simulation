# Cellular-Automata-Material-Simulation

If you are going to try this out, just keep in mind that currently, there is essentialy nothing to check out, just some pixels that fall down the screen and can stack ontop of eachother.

From my testing, it is buttery smooth. If you do encounter bad performance, just remember that I am still working on optimizing it.

How to test it out:

Download and unzip the project. After that, just double click 'index.html'.

Controls:

Right Arrow: Cycles materials right.
Left Arrow: Cycles materials left.

Move your cursor around to spawn in 'bits'. But thats just what I call them.
