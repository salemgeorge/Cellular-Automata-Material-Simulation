v0.1

•Dirt and Sand added
•Spawn in bits
•Collision for those bits
•Different types of bits fall faster or slower

v0.2 (Big Update)

•Optimization(Game runs infinteley better)
•Toppling:
    Different types of bits have different types of toppling. Sand for example keeps falling. Whereas dirt only falls if the height restriction isn't met.
•Destruction:
    You can now left click on bits in order to destroy them. In the future I am going to add the ability for mass destruction.
